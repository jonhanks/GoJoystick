This is a simple program with the following goals:

* Learn how SDL handles joysticks
* Do so using Go (because it is a fun language)
* Create a program to train my children on how to use gamepads/joysticks

Currently it displays a colored rectangle for each active joystick/gamepad.  Pressing buttons on the joystick increase the size of the rectangle.  Letters of the alphabet are displayed, as the joystick rectangles collide with the letters, they disappear triggering the next letter.

You must have a true type font installed as "font.ttf" in the same directory as the application.  I am presently not distributing any files.

These files are in the public domain.
